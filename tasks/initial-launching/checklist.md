# Project Implementation Checklist

## âœ… BREAKTHROUGH: Nuxt 4 Directory Structure Issue Resolved!

**Problem**: Pages were blank due to Nuxt 4's new directory structure requirement
**Solution**: Moved pages from `/pages/` to `/app/pages/` (Nuxt 4 standard)
**Result**: Pages now render correctly with file-based routing working

## General Guidelines

- Prioritize responsive design and mobile friendly layout for all components
- Ensure all components are accessible and user-friendly
- Follow best practices for code quality and maintainability
- Use consistent naming conventions and coding styles
- Document all components and features clearly
- Implement error handling and logging from the start
- Admin view could be hided for public and accessible only by localhost,
  this will help to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data in this phase
