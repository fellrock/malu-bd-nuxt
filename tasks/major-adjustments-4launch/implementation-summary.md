# Major Adjustments for Launch - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

This document summarizes the successful implementation of the major restructuring for the Maria Luiza 4 Anos event management application.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Database Schema Restructuring
- ✅ Added new `Category` enum (Amigos, Creche, Familia, Padrinhos)
- ✅ Updated `Guest` model with new fields:
  - `category` - Guest category
  - `referenceCode` - Family/group reference name
  - `kidAge` - Child age (optional)
  - `maleKid` - Child gender (optional)
  - `cancelledAt` - Soft deletion timestamp
  - `surveyRatingId` - Future rating system FK
- ✅ Removed unused fields (`giftChoice`, `plusOnes`, `surveyRating`)
- ✅ Made `email` optional but unique when provided
- ✅ Made `name` unique for data integrity
- ✅ Removed unique constraint from `inviteCode` for group sharing
- ✅ Added database indexes for performance

### API Routes Restructuring
- ✅ Updated `/api/guests.get.ts` for group-based statistics
- ✅ Updated `/api/guest-code/[code].get.ts` to return guest groups
- ✅ Updated `/api/rsvp.post.ts` for new schema
- ✅ Created `/api/group-guests.put.ts` for group management
- ✅ Created `/api/cancel-guests.post.ts` for guest cancellation
- ✅ Created `/api/import-guests.post.ts` for CSV import
- ✅ Created `/api/export-guests.get.ts` for data export
- ✅ Updated all Zod validation schemas

### Admin Page (/admin)
- ✅ Redesigned dashboard for group-based statistics
- ✅ Updated table to show `referenceCode` instead of individual names
- ✅ Added category badges and guest count per group
- ✅ Implemented expandable group details
- ✅ Added CSV import functionality with modal
- ✅ Added data export functionality
- ✅ Maintained glass-morphism design system

### Invitation Page (/convite/[code])
- ✅ Created new invitation page replacing RSVP
- ✅ Implemented event summary with key information
- ✅ Built group guest management form
- ✅ Added conditional kid fields (age, gender, checkbox)
- ✅ Implemented reject button with confirmation dialog
- ✅ Added form validation and error handling
- ✅ Created success modal with event page navigation
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices

### Event Page (/evento/[code])
- ✅ Created new event information page
- ✅ Added guest group display with individual controls
- ✅ Implemented guest edit/cancel functionality
- ✅ Added event timeline ("Cronograma do Evento")
- ✅ Included countdown timer
- ✅ Added photo sharing section with QR code placeholder
- ✅ Included location information with map link
- ✅ Added dress code and parking information
- ✅ Created modals for guest editing and cancellation

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### From Individual to Group Management
- **Before**: Each guest had separate RSVP entries with `plusOnes` counter
- **After**: Guests grouped by `referenceCode` sharing same `inviteCode`

### Three-Page Structure
1. **Admin** (`/admin`) - Host management interface
2. **Invitation** (`/convite/[code]`) - Guest confirmation interface  
3. **Event** (`/evento/[code]`) - Event information and guest management

### Data Flow
```
Admin creates guests → Generates invite codes → Guests access /convite/CODE → 
Complete form → Confirm presence → Access /evento/CODE for event info
```

## 📊 Features Implemented

### Family/Group Management
- Multiple guests per `inviteCode`
- Shared `referenceCode` for family identification
- Group operations (confirm all, cancel all, edit individual)

### Child-Specific Features
- Age tracking with `kidAge` field
- Gender tracking with `maleKid` boolean
- Conditional form fields based on "is child" checkbox

### Import/Export Functionality
- CSV import with validation and error reporting
- Data export for backup and analysis
- Minimum required fields: name, category, referenceCode

### Enhanced UX
- Glass-morphism design maintained throughout
- Mobile-responsive design on all pages
- Loading states and error handling
- Success confirmations and user feedback
- Portuguese language interface

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

### Database
- PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Soft deletion pattern with `cancelledAt`
- Indexed fields for performance (`inviteCode`, `referenceCode`)
- Data integrity with unique constraints where appropriate

### API
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- Zod validation for all inputs
- Comprehensive error handling
- Consistent response format

### Frontend
- Vue 3 with Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- Nuxt 4 for SSR and routing
- Responsive CSS with modern design patterns

## 🧪 Testing Status

### Manual Testing Completed
